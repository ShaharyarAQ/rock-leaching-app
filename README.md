# 🔬 Rock Leachate Prediction Application

This application predicts:

- **Leachate volume (ml)** after rainfall or snowfall  
- **Leachate chemical composition** (Ca, Mg, Na, K, EC, pH, etc.)
- Based on **rock chemical properties**, **event parameters**, and **historical cumulative exposure**

The app is implemented in **Streamlit** and uses **machine learning regression models** trained on the provided dataset.
